# Celestial Paddle

**Celestial Paddle** is a space-themed breakout-style game where you control a glowing paddle to bounce a ball and break cosmic blocks. Set against a starry backdrop, your goal is to clear all the blocks and achieve the highest score possible. The game combines classic arcade mechanics with a vibrant, celestial aesthetic.

## Gameplay

In each round, you control the paddle to keep the ball in play and break all the blocks on the board. As you progress, the ball bounces off the paddle and blocks, and you must prevent it from falling below the paddle. Clear all blocks to win the round!

- **Right Arrow / D**: Move paddle right
- **Spacebar**: Launch the ball (on start screen)
- **R**: Restart the game (on game over screen)

There are special powerup blocks:

- **Green blocks**: Temporarily increase the size of the ball.
